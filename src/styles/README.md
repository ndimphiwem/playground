# Betway Style Guide

## Abstracts
Put all your functions here, along with variables and mixins. In short, all your helpers.

## Base
in here, put all your boilerplate code. By boilerplate, I mean all CSS code you’re gonna write each 
time you’ll start a new project. For example: typography rules, animations, utilities (by utilities, 
I mean classes like `margin-right-large` , `text-center` , …) and so on.

## Components
The name is explicit here. This folder contains all the components used to build your pages 
like your buttons, forms, swipers, popups, and so on.

## Layout
used to layout the different parts of your page, that is to say, your header, 
footer, navigation, section, your own grid, and more.

## Themes
If you have different themes for your app (dark mode, admin, and so on) put them in this folder.

## Pages
You may sometimes have a page that has its own specific style, that stands out from what you do usually. 
Then put your style in the `pages` folder.

## Vendors
what would be an app or a project without external libraries? Put in the `vendors` folder 
all files that don’t depend on you. You may want to add your Font Awesome file, 
Bootstrap, and stuff like that in here.
